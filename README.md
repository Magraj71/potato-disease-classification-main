## 🚀 About this project
This is my full-stack Machine Learning project where I built a complete potato disease classifier system.  
It includes model training, FastAPI backend, React frontend, mobile app, TF-Lite conversion, and optional GCP deployment.


---

## 🔖 Highlights (My contributions)
- Custom training experiments and improved preprocessing.
- Clean FastAPI endpoints with structured responses.
- Redesigned and branded React frontend.
- TF-Lite model setup for mobile-level inference.
- GCP-ready deployment scripts.
- Added my own improvements, utilities, and experimentation flow.

## ⚙️ Quickstart (Roshan's Development Flow)

### 🔧 1) Install Python Dependencies
    pip install -r training/requirements.txt
    pip install -r api/requirements.txt

### 🚀 2) Run FastAPI Backend
    cd api
    uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    # API URL → http://localhost:8000

### 🌐 3) Run Frontend
    cd frontend
    npm install --from-lock-json
    cp .env.example .env
    # Set REACT_APP_API_URL to http://localhost:8000
    npm start

### 📱 4) Run Mobile App
    cd mobile-app
    yarn install
    cp .env.example .env
    npm run android   # or npm run ios

## 🧠 Model Training (Short Overview)
1. Download the PlantVillage dataset (keep only Potato-related folders).  
2. Open `training/potato-disease-training.ipynb` or my `roshan_experiments.ipynb`.  
3. Update dataset path in the notebook.  
4. Train the model step-by-step.  
5. Export the model into `saved_models/<version>`  
6. Convert to TF-Lite and save in `tf-lite-models/`

## 🧾 API Endpoints (FastAPI)
- **POST /predict**  
  → Takes an image, returns `{ "label": "...", "confidence": 0.92 }`

- **GET /health**  
  → Basic health-check endpoint

Full API examples are inside `/api/`.

## 📌 Notes from Roshan
This project represents my complete end-to-end ML engineering workflow —  
from dataset preparation and model training to API development, UI integration, mobile app support, and cloud deployment.
